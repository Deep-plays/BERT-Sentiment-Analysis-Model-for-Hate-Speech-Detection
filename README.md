# BERT-Sentiment-Analysis-Model-for-Hate-Speech-Detection
This repository contains a BERT-based sentiment analysis model specifically trained to detect hate speech on Twitter. The model utilizes Deep learning techniques and natural language processing to classify tweets as either hateful or non-hateful.
Dataset:
The model has been trained using a carefully curated dataset of Twitter data containing instances of hate speech. The dataset includes a wide range of hate speech examples to ensure comprehensive training.

Preprocessing:
The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to clean and prepare the text data for analysis. This includes removing noise, tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words. The preprocessing ensures that the data is in a suitable format for the sentiment analysis model.

BERT-based Model:
The sentiment analysis model is built using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. BERT is a powerful transformer-based model that has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various natural language processing tasks.

Training:
The BERT model is trained on the hate speech dataset using supervised learning. The training process involves feeding the preprocessed text data into the model and optimizing the model's parameters to accurately classify tweets as hateful or non-hateful.

Evaluation:
The trained model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The evaluation helps assess the model's effectiveness in detecting hate speech and provides insights into its strengths and limitations.

Usage:
To utilize the BERT sentiment analysis model for hate speech detection, follow the steps outlined in the provided notebook or code files. The code provides instructions on loading the trained model, preprocessing input text, and obtaining predictions.
